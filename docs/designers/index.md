# Experimental Design

The EXAUQ-Toolbox provides a variety of Python functions, classes etc. to support doing
experimental design. This section provides tutorials and user guides to help you get up
to speed with using these in your own analyses.

If this is your first time using the EXAUQ-Toolbox for sequential design, have a look
at... TODO.
