# Tutorials

In this section you will find tutorials that show you how to get up-and-running with
creating experimental designs using the EXAUQ-Toolbox.

If this is your first time using
the toolbox for experimental design, start with
[Training a Gaussian Process Emulator](./training_gp_tutorial.ipynb), which introduces
the core objects for creating training data and training a Gaussian process emulator.
From there, you have a couple of options:

- If you wish to do multi-level emulation / experimental design, move on to
  [Training a Multi-Level Gaussian Process Emulator](./training_multi_level_gp_tutorial.ipynb).
- If you want to perform adaptive sampling in the single-level (i.e. non-levelled)
  paradigm, look at [Single Level Adaptive Sampling](./slas_tutorial.ipynb).
