# Tutorials

In this section you will find tutorials that show you how to get up-and-running with
creating experimental designs using the EXAUQ-Toolbox.

If this is your first time using
the toolbox for experimental design, start with
[Training a Gaussian Process Emulator](./training_gp_tutorial.ipynb), which introduces
the core objects for creating training data and training a Gaussian process emulator.
