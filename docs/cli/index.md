# Command Line Application

The EXAUQ-Toolbox provides a command line application, called `exauq`, for submitting and
managing simulations.

If this is your first time using the command line application, have a look at
[how to write a simulator script](./simulator-script.md) and the
[walkthrough](./first-walkthrough.md).
