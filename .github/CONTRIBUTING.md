Firstly say that we are thankful that you want to contribute to the EXAUQ-TOOLBOX
Please read this contributing guide in full (and refer back to it when necessary) before
opening issues/creating PRs etc. just to help the maintenance team out!

# Issues
--------

Add some text in here about how to structure good issues etc.

Types of issues (Main examples but not limited to):
1) Questions regarding usage of the toolbox etc. 
2) Bugs
3) Feature Requests

When writing an issue, particularly a bug/feature request, it should have some form 
of motivation, preferably an example (ie a bug is doing this but I expect this) or
I want a feature to do this in this case. Then it should have some form of acceptance criteria
ie. this issue can be closed if for example, bug is fixed, or feature implemented could solve
this and this for example. 

Poorly written issues will likely not be resolved without further clarification and if none received
will likely be removed. 

Please also link 1 bug/ 1 feature request to 1 issue. If you have multiple, that is great - but please
create multiple separate issues for these to be solved.

# PRs
------

Fill in text about how to structure PRs

A PR should close at least 1 issue. Draft/WIP PRs are fully encouraged so that the maintaners of the 
toolbox can see what you are working on. Within the PR please clearly document which issue(s) you are closing
alongside a good description of how this issue has been closed by your PR. (Note: A well written issue will make this a lot
easier!)

When you think you have finished the PR please, **before requesting a review** remember to 
1) Double check you have updated all of the relevent documentation including API, user guides / tutorials
2) Run all of the unittests
3) There are (will be) github workflows such as linting and documents rebuilding that will occur before merging. (However, a quick
test of this yourself is also appreciated!). 

# Documentation Styling
------------------------

Fill in text about documentation styling 

Mostly following NumPy styling for conventions except a few things in the API to help out (HW will update this fully post cleaning the
API documentation). 

# User Guides & Tutorials
---------------------------

Fill in text here about how to write good user guides and tutorials following TH link advice (HW will find and write!)


# Labels
---------

Fill in text about different labels that can be used within the Toolbox depending on what people want to contribute. 
(ie making use of the goodfirst issue label as a new contributor etc. )
